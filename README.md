# score-computer_science
non-linear navigation in the field of computer science wich is the systematic way of understanding and shaping algorithmic systems — how they work, what they can do, and how we can build and reason about them using logic, mathematics, and machines

## [Layer 1: Foundations](diegoabeltran16/score-computer_science/01_Foundations)

**The theoretical core of computation:** Foundations become the soil (what's possible)

### 🧩 Purpose

Foundations define what is computable, how to reason about it, and how to measure computational effort.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Defines the limits of computation (e.g., Halting Problem)
- Provides formal languages of reasoning (logic, induction)
- Enables performance analysis (Big-O, complexity)
- Bridges theory and implementation
- Trains computational thinking

## [Layer 2: Core Systems](diegoabeltran16/score-computer_science/02_Core_Systems)

**How computation is expressed and managed:** Core Systems the roots (how things operate)

### 🧩 Purpose

Builds the infrastructure that turns theory into runnable systems.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Translates logic into execution
- Shapes language and runtime behavior
- Supports layered system design (OS, DBs, networks)
- Drives performance and reliability
- Core to modern software ecosystems

---

## [Layer 3: Application Domains](diegoabeltran16/score-computer_science/03_Applications)

**Real-world uses of computation:** Applications the branches (where it's used)

### 🧩 Purpose

Applies CS principles to solve domain-specific challenges in society and industry.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Drives innovation and utility
- Grounds theory in practice
- Intersects with other disciplines
- Surfaces ethical, legal, and usability issues

---

## [Layer 4: Cross-Cutting Concerns](diegoabeltran16/score-computer_science/04_Cross_Cutting)

**Universal design constraints and principles:** Cross-Cutting the nutrients (qualities that affect all growth)

### 🧩 Purpose

Addresses qualities every system must satisfy—regardless of function or domain.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Impacts every system dimension (performance, ethics, UX)
- Requires trade-off awareness and design maturity
- Drives systemic safety, trust, and usability

---

## [Layer 5: Methodology](diegoabeltran16/score-computer_science/05_Methodology)

**How we test, validate, and evolve computation:** Methodology the gardener’s tools (how to observe, test, refine)

### 🧩 Purpose

Provides the tools for rigor, repeatability, and improvement in CS.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Grounds CS in scientific rigor
- Supports engineering refinement
- Unifies theoretical and empirical approaches
