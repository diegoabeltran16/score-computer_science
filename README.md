# score-computer_science
non-linear navigation in the field of computer science wich is the systematic way of understanding and shaping algorithmic systems — how they work, what they can do, and how we can build and reason about them using logic, mathematics, and machines

## [Layer 1: Foundations](diegoabeltran16/score-computer_science/01_Foundations)

**The theoretical core of computation.**

### 🧩 Purpose

Foundations define what is computable, how to reason about it, and how to measure computational effort.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Defines the limits of computation (e.g., Halting Problem)
- Provides formal languages of reasoning (logic, induction)
- Enables performance analysis (Big-O, complexity)
- Bridges theory and implementation
- Trains computational thinking
